Basic teaching exercises in JS

These are my solutions to basic JavaScript exercises that are taken from the playlist available [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpc_YvcwbxaSn6jn0VaTcG8A0Grgs1GSB). The videos in this series cover basic JS exercises that are great for beginners. I urge you to check out [Junior Developer Central](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuvTObpdx__W966kbdIZ4_Q) if you are keen to practice your JS.

Before watching the solutions, you should try to figure out how you would tackle each problem. A good resource for finding inspiration that I use every time I try to write JS, is the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).
